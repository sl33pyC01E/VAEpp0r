# VAEpp

*No dataset? No problem.*

Procedural synthetic data pretraining for causal temporal video autoencoders.

VAEpp trains a video VAE entirely on procedurally generated data -- zero real images required. The generator produces structured synthetic images and video clips with controllable shape composition, scene templates, mathematical patterns, and physics-driven motion. A VAE trained on this synthetic data achieves **pixel-perfect out-of-distribution reconstruction** on real video after temporal training, closing ~90% of the domain gap before any real data is introduced.

## Architecture

- 8x spatial compression, configurable 1-4x temporal compression
- Configurable latent channels (3-32), encoder/decoder widths
- Optional FSQ (Finite Scalar Quantization) for discrete latent tokens
- Flatten/Deflatten bottleneck for 1D latent serialization (for downstream world models)

## Procedural Generator

Three-tier GPU-accelerated generation pipeline:

1. **Shape Bank** -- 10 SDF primitives (circle, rect, triangle, ellipse, blob, line, stroke, hatch, stipple, fractal) x 4 textures (flat, perlin, gradient, voronoi) x 3 edges (hard, soft, textured)
2. **Base Layers** -- Composited scenes from shape bank with 19 scene templates (horizon, perspective, block city, landscape, road, water, forest, etc.)
3. **Final Output** -- Fast layer compositing with transforms, stamps, micro-stamps, post-processing

### Pattern System (38 generators)

Clean mathematical/structural patterns with zero shape compositing:
- Gradients (linear, radial, angular, diamond, multi-stop)
- Tilings (checkerboard, stripes, hexagonal, brick, herringbone, basketweave, fish scale, chevron, argyle)
- Waves (sine, interference/moire, concentric rings, spirals, ripples)
- Mathematical surfaces (quadratic contours, Lissajous, rose curves, spirograph, Julia sets)
- Symmetry/Op Art (kaleidoscope, warped grids, Islamic star patterns)
- Procedural natural (reaction-diffusion, contour maps, wood grain, marble, cracked earth)
- Art exercises (zentangle, maze generation, contour lines, squiggle fill)
- Fine-grain (halftone, ordered dither, stipple density)

### Disco Quadrant Mode

Balanced training data diversity:
- 25% pure mathematical patterns
- 25% pattern collages with sparse shape overlay
- 25% dense random compositing (cranked micro-stamps)
- 25% structured scene templates

### Temporal

Physics-driven motion (gravity, velocity, bounce), viewport transforms (pan, zoom, rotation), fluid advection, parallax layers. Motion stored as compact JSON recipes (~1KB vs ~9MB rendered).

## Training Pipeline

| Stage | Data | Temporal | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Static synthetic | No | RGB image reconstruction |
| 2 | Temporal synthetic | 4x | Video reconstruction with temporal consistency |
| 3 | FSQ | Optional | Quantize continuous latent to discrete tokens |
| 4 | Flatten | Optional | 1D bottleneck for sequence input |

## GUI

Tkinter desktop app with nested tab layout:

- **Data** -- Static generator controls, video generator with motion pool
- **Models** -- Training, inference, checkpoint conversion (static + video)
- **Compress** -- FSQ quantization, flatten/deflatten experiments (static + video)

All tabs support disco quadrant mode, resume from checkpoint, and auto-save inference outputs.

## Model Presets

| Preset | Channels | Latent | Params | Size |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|------|
| Pico | 3 | 4 | 1.0M | 4 MB |
| Nano | 3 | 8 | 1.2M | 5 MB |
| Tiny | 3 | 16 | 3.3M | 13 MB |
| Small | 3 | 16 | 4.0M | 16 MB |
| Medium | 3 | 32 | 11.3M | 43 MB |
